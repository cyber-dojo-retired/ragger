The main src code is in the /app dir.
This is added to the docker image using the Dockerfile command:
COPY --chown=nobody:nogroup . /app
Note: this sets the ownership of everything underneath /app
but it does not set the ownership of /app itself.

There are some tests in /test/server
These are volume-mounted into, and run from inside a docker container
using docker-compose.yml:

  ragger:
    read_only: true
    volumes: [ "./test:/app/test:ro" ]

I would prefer to have code and tests in a 'non-parental' dir structure. Eg
/app
/test

The problem is that I want full coverage of both the source _and_ tests
and SimpleCov appears unable to work 'across' two dirs like this.
If you try SimpleCov.root('/') it just does not work.

It might be possible to add sym-link to fake it, but the ln command
would not be possible inside the read-only file-system.

test/client and test/server usefully share a number of files:
- check_test_results.rb
- coverage.rb
- run.sh
