Once ragger is a working think about the customizations like James does, eg
  - detecting printf's in the source
  - detecting lack of coverage
  - a lot of ambers in a row
  - that was a big change!

This could be bundled into the ragger. Viz the ragger is
generalized and is passed a hash containing lots of data
not just stdout,stderr,status.

However, I think it might be simpler as a SEPARATE service.
An linter/advister service.
It would expose a function, maybe a lambda in the browser.
Initially in Ruby, later in any language? eg Python
It would be passed much more information than the ragger,
probably in a hash, eg, stdin ==> hash[:stdin]

  - stdout,stderr,status
  - timed_out (true/false)
  - traffic-light-colour  :red,:amber,:green,:faulty
  - previous traffic-light sequence
  - duration  (secs.msecs)
  - all new_files
  - all old_files
  - created filenames
  - changed filenames
  - deleted filenames
  - diff from previous files

Possible names like linter...
  advisor    >>> yes I like this. least "formal" <<<
  helper
  mentor - like this too
  marker
  evaluator
  grader
  assessor
  appraiser,
  feedbacker
  signaller
