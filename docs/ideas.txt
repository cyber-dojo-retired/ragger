Once ragger is a working I would like to enhance it...

The rag-lambda source would come from the start-point image
and not from the test-framework image.

The rag-lambda would take a hash instead of stdin,stdout,status.
So, eg, stdin ==> hash[:stdin]
This would allow easy expansion getting web to pass extra
information. For example,
  - stdout,stderr,status
  - timed_out (true/false)
  - duration  (secs.msecs)
  - all visible files
  - created files
  - changed files
  - deleted files
  - diff from previous files
  - the full traffic-light sequence info (till this point)


Getting the rag-lambda source from the start-point image opens
up the option of exposing it in the browser as an editable file.
This would be a very nice feature for teachers wishing to make
customizations like James does, eg
  - detecting printf's in the source
  - detecting lack of coverage

It also suggests the idea of somehow getting the rag-lambda source
to create a separate file which acts as automated feedback.
