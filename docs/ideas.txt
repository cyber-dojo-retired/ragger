The rag-lambda source would come from the start-point image at first,
(later from the browser as an editable file), and not from the
test-framework image.


Possible names: lighter?, trafficker?, ragger? colourer?
I think this could be implemented by calling runner...
The runner would be passed the cat command in its cyber-dojo.sh
This still leaves the ragger doing the eval of the lambda src.
It would be nice if the runner did the eval too.
That will be required when the lambda-src is exposed in the browser.
