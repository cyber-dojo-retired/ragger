Currently RagLambdaCache.new_image() gets the lambda from the
image using a custom cyber-dojo.sh inside runner.
This is overkill. Simpler to have a dedicated traffic_light_src()
method in runner that uses docker directly. Viz it does
  docker run --rm --entrypoint cat ${image_name} /usr/local/bin/red_amber_green.rb

When creating a new LTF image there could initially be no
red_amber_green.rb file. Perhaps the docker run command above
could be a bit more resilient in this case?

Changed by mind. Better for runner to have just its run_cyber_dojo_sh method.
