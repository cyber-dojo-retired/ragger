IDE's have a lot of richness in the way devs create code.
But they have a lot less richness in the feedback of the
results of that code.
I would like cyber-dojo to try to be richer in its feedback.
Have two modes.
- One for input where you press [test] button.
- One for output where you see sss and has [resume] button.

How about removing stdout/stderr/status from main kata screen.
Have it just containing.

Instead when you press the [test] button
what you get back is a screen very like the diff-view.
But much reduced...
No < > navigation.
No sequence of traffic-lights, just the current traffic-light.
No diff-check-box.
No fork/revert/download buttons.
Has stdout/stderr/status but these are NOT shown as a diff.
