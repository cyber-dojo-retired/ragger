There is a problem with caching...
Now that cron->puller is working there is a possible daily
update of language-test-framework images, such as
cyberdojofoundation/gpp_assert
However, their /usr/local/bin/red_amber_green.rb
file is not being read because of the cache...

So...
def colour(image_name, id, stdout, stderr, status)
  @cache[image_name] ||= eval(get_rag_lambda_src(image_name, id), empty_binding)
  rag = @cache[image_name].call(stdout, stderr, status)

needs to become

def colour(image_name, id, stdout, stderr, status)
  red_amber_green = eval(get_rag_lambda_src(image_name, id), empty_binding)
  rag = red_amber_green.call(stdout, stderr, status)

Doing an eval here is safe because the lambda is still
coming from the image.
