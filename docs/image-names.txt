Recent update to Java-Junit5 breaks backward compatibility
for old sessions. How to fix this issue?

Make an image-name include its version number(s).
Eg the repo cyberdojofoundation/java12-junit5 holds a manifest.json
file which includes:
{
  "display_name": "Java 12, JUnit 5",
  "image_name": "cyberdojofoundation/java12_junit5", // always :latest
  ...
}

Keeping the :latest tag means the puller can repull every
24 hours to get security updates.
It becomes important for the languages and custom images
to return all image_names that exist in sessions. Viz even
if an start-point is removed, its image-name must still be
served to puller so updates are pulled. The simplest is maybe
to have a list of retired image-names that are included
in the list served to the puller.

Adding the commit SHA inside the image as an env-var means
when you restart a session you can be notified if the target
image has changed.

With separate repos, the Dockerfile needs its commands to be
more carefully written to install specific versions.
