Once ragger is a working think about the customizations like James does, eg
  - detecting printf's in the source
  - detecting lack of coverage
  - a lot of ambers in a row
  - that was a big change!

A generalization of the progress_regex from manifest.json

This suggests the idea of yet another service, an "advisor"
A SEPARATE service.
Similarly it would expose a function, maybe a lambda.
Initially in Ruby, later in any language? eg Python
It would be passed much more information than the ragger,
probably in a hash, eg, stdin ==> hash[:stdin]

  - stdout,stderr,status
  - timed_out (true/false)
  - duration  (secs.msecs)
  - all visible files
  - all previous files
  - created files
  - changed files
  - deleted files
  - diff from previous files
  - the full traffic-light sequence info (till this point)

Possible names like linter...
  advisor    >>> yes I like this. least "formal" <<<
  helper
  mentor - like this too
  marker
  evaluator
  grader
  assessor
  appraiser,
  feedbacker
  signaller
