At the moment if a rag-lambda does not return one of :red,:amber,:green
then it is mapped to :amber

Change this so it is mapped to :faulty
and have a traffic-light image for :faulty

This will help when the rag-lambda is exposed as
an actual source file in kata/edit.

Would be nice if the traffic-light images
where held in ragger too, and redirected from nginx
(Like avatar images are now redirected from nginx to avatars)
