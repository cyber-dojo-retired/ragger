At the moment if a rag-lambda does not return one of :red,:amber,:green
then it is mapped to :amber by ragger.

Change this so it is mapped to :faulty
and have a traffic-light image for :faulty

This will help when the rag-lambda is exposed as
an actual source file in kata/edit.

Until saver can accept a colour of faulty,
in web, map faulty back to amber when doing saver.kata_ran_tests()
but allow faulty to get to browser.

Also in web, if ragger raises an exception, then trap
that and map that to faulty too. This makes cyber-dojo more
fault tolerant.

Would be nice if the traffic-light images
where held in ragger too, and redirected from nginx
(Like avatar images are now redirected from nginx to avatars)
